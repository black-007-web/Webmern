Step 1 – Greeting & Self-introduction

“Good morning/afternoon everyone. My name is [Your Name], and today I’m going to talk about a topic that affects all of us — The Role of Emotional Intelligence in Turning Conflict into Collaboration.”

Step 2 – Hook (grab their attention)

“Conflict happens everywhere — at work, in school, and even at home. But have you ever noticed how some people can take a tense situation and somehow turn it into a productive conversation? The secret behind that is often emotional intelligence.”

Step 3 – Transition into the topic

“In this presentation, we’ll explore what emotional intelligence is, how it works in conflicts, and how it can help us move from arguments to cooperation.”

Slide 3 – The 4 Pillars of Emotional Intelligence
You say:
“So, what exactly is Emotional Intelligence?

It’s the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions — and also to recognize, understand, and influence the emotions of others.

Psychologist Daniel Goleman describes four main pillars of emotional intelligence:

“First, Self-awareness: This is about recognizing your own emotional state in the middle of a conflict — noticing if you’re frustrated, defensive, or upset.

Second, Self-management: Once you’re aware, you can control your reactions instead of letting emotions control you. This could mean pausing before responding or taking a deep breath to stay calm.

Third, Social awareness: This is empathy — sensing and understanding what the other person might be feeling, even if they’re not saying it directly.

And fourth, Relationship management: Using all of these skills to communicate effectively, handle disagreements, and build trust.”


How Emotional Intelligence Turns Conflict into Collaboration

Emotional Intelligence helps reduce emotional escalation by encouraging us to think before we speak, keeping conversations calm and respectful. It also promotes empathy, allowing us to understand others’ perspectives better.

By focusing on solutions instead of blame, Emotional Intelligence improves problem-solving during conflicts. When people feel understood and respected, trust grows, making collaboration easier and stronger.

Slide 4 – Conflict Without vs With Emotional Intelligence
You say:
  
“Let’s imagine two colleagues, Alex and Sam, disagree over who gets to use an important piece of equipment.

Without emotional intelligence: They both raise their voices, interrupt each other, and start accusing each other of being unfair.

With emotional intelligence: Alex recognizes he’s frustrated (self-awareness), takes a breath before replying (self-management), listens to Sam’s concern about a tight deadline (social awareness), and suggests sharing the equipment on a schedule (relationship management).

Same situation — but completely different outcome.”
Closing line:

“Conflict is inevitable — but with emotional intelligence, collaboration is a choice we can make every time.”
